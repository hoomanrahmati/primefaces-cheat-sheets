# primefaces-cheat-sheets

This repository is only for snipped code from DeepSeek and other websites about primefaces:

```
PrimeFaces.ajax.Request.handle({
    oncomplete: function(xhr, status, args) {
        console.log("Full response:", xhr.responseText);
    }
});
```

# to have fun

first of all you need to add some extra code

```
PrimeFaces.ajax.Request.handle({
    oncomplete: function(xhr, status, args) {
        console.log("Full response:", xhr.responseText);
    }
});
```

# Performance:

1. Limit processed components with process

2. Use partial updates with update

3. Set async: false only when absolutely necessary

- hello

this worked **fine** form me!
